# Deploy MicroShift on an OSTree based system
by Diego Alvarez

As Edge computing evolves and increases every time, new requirements and capabilities are needed in order to deploy and manage workloads on the Edge. 
Microshift arises from the necessity to have a solution capable of provide the same experience that we could have by running OpenShift/Kubernetes on 
traditional infrastructures, but keeping in mind the aim to decrease the footprint to be able to run in field-deployed edge computing devices. 

In addition, to ensure basic security standards, an edge device deployed in the field should run an operating system optimizd to be inmutable, and based 
in transactions for rollbacks and upgrades. Those transactions should be done in a securely and safely way, in addition to be speedly, but always 
avoiding workloads disrruptions. All those requirements metioned before could be addressed by running MicroShift in a OSTree based system.
